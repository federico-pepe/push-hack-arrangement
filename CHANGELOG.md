# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- Project created. Plan added.
- Milestone 1: Go skeleton draws a static 960x160 test frame in display takeover; `-preview` writes a PNG without a device.
- Milestone 2: Shift+Session (CC49+CC51) toggles Arrangement Mode: display takeover + MIDI intercept, ON/OFF message on screen, release on exit. `scripts/deploy.sh` runs it on the Push.
- `core` now taken from GitHub (core v0.2.0), no local replace.
- Toggle changed: Shift+Session shows the view (title "Arrangement Mode"); the second press closes it at once, no message.
- Milestone 3a: read the newest saved Live Set (.als) and draw all tracks, clips, locators, loop and insert marker fit to the screen. Reloads when the file changes.
